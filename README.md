Built With Badges
=================

Based on the [Built with Grunt badge idea](http://gruntjs.com/built-with-grunt-badge), we wanted to display all technologies we use in our project README. We decided to create more badges.

If you use a tech or a tool in a project and want to proudly display that in your project README or on your project website? Now you can with the "Built with Badges"!

As you can see, the "Built with Badges" has been designed to fit nicely next to all your project's other mini-badges. You can put it first, last, or anywhere in the middle. Have fun!
